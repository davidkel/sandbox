- more of a problem now. no verify false option supported, although it is declared.

- if credential store not provided as below, in client section looks like it uses the working directory as default
well I can find the key for the enroll persisted, but not for the other info such as cert and state store

credentialStore: 
 path: "/tmp/state-store"
 cryptoStore: 
  path: "/tmp/msp"

- no channel: event service creation failed: could not get chConfig cache reference: no channel peers configured for channel [davechannel]

added channel section
channels: 
 davechannel: 
  peers: 
    peer0.org1.example.com:


Does use service discovery by default (not sure how you override this as yet)

debug go grpc calls
GODEBUG=http2debug=2

GRPC_GO_LOG_VERBOSITY_LEVEL=4
GRPC_GO_LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL=INFO (that is the highest)


With Go I ensured I couldn't work with a peer from each org and it keeps failing to connect as it chooses them and doesn't 
handle it.

Problems as well with discovery and the tlsCA cert for the orderer. It works if I define the orderer in the connection profile otherwise it doesn't
